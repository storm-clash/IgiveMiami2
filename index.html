                <p>More than 36,000 vulnerable individuals
                    and families are assisted each year by CCLS. CCLS is 
                    committed to making a positive impact on the 
                    community by helping poor immigrants obtain asylum, establish legal residency, become citizens, reunite families and provide public education. The staff at CCLS work tirelessly to advocate for immigrants’ rights and provide culturally competent and trauma-informed legal services and representation to the most vulnerable communities in Miami and Broward counties including unaccompanied children, families, detainees, victims of crime, and asylum seekers from all over the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>Your help makes all the difference in helping CCLS be responsive to humanitarian crises that arise and help low-income immigrants get access to due process and high-quality legal representation. We rely on community support to keep the programs thriving. There is so much on the line for the families served – please help support our work!  Thank you for your support!</p>

                <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
                <p>Catholic Legal Services grew out of the G.W.L. Legal Project, established in 1994 at Notre Dame D’Haiti Pierre Toussaint Center to provide legal services and immigration representation to refugees and immigrants from Haiti. The project rapidly expanded beyond the Haitian community because of the vast immigrant community in South Florida. Incorporated on January 8, 1998, when the G.W.L. Legal Project (1994) merged with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network in Miami (1988), CCLS has become one of the most active nonprofit providers of legal immigration services in Florida.</p>
                <p>From 3 staff to 100 staff including 45 attorneys and 6 DOJ-accredited representatives [A DOJ-AR is a person who is approved by the Department of Justice to represent aliens before the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which includes the immigration courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and must maintain a high standard of professional conduct] with two locations in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, CCLS has served refugees and immigrants from around the world. Most CCLS clients come from across the Americas, and CCLS staff reflect their diversity of language and culture.</p>
                <p>More than three thousand individuals seek the services of CCLS each month including immigrants seeking to reunite with their families, many of whom were separated at the border; political and religious refugees seeking safety and security, many of whom have experienced persecution and torture; battered spouses and their children; religious workers seeking to minister to U.S. religious communities; and long-term residents of the United States with significant family and community ties who face deportation. These services include representation before the Immigration Court, Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), United States Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Juvenile Court.</p>
                <p>These individuals, ranging from 2 months to 104 years of age, confront a complex immigration law system and a confusing bureaucracy. Many have unhealed wounds from a painful past and then encounter unexpected bigotry and barriers as they adjust to a new culture and way of life. They often face an uncertain future. However, with CCLS help, many deserving immigrants and refugees persevere and realize their dreams for a bright and secure future in the United States.</p>
                <p>Every little bit helps make a difference in the lives of South Florida immigrants. Please contact us at administratorcls@cclsmiami.org or cell 305-942-5213 or visit us at www.cclsmiami.org.  Thank you for your consideration and support and let’s keep families united! </p>
